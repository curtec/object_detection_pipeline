# Object Detection Pipeline
Complete tutorial on building a object detection system
The aim of this tutorial is to build all of the componants required to build a objct detection system. The main thread will be to build a system based on YOLO 11 on custom data, there will also be branches to incorporate other methods for detecting objects in images.
There will be a branch to deal with multimodel models such as florence2 which allow the user to pose plain text queries concerning and image.
Whenever I use {} this means that the user should remove this code including the {} and replace this with their code, e.g. At the command prompt type python -m venv {the name that you require for your venv} -> At the command prompt type python -m venv .venv

# Setup GITHUB
1. My first step is always to setup and clone a github repositry for the project.
2. Once I create a github repositry with a readme and mit licence the next step is to edit the gitignore file to include and file that uses the format .* (so and file that begins with a dot as this is the way that I like to name my venv and I rarely use other files that are formatted this way).
3. Clone the repositry to your local computer.
4. cd into directory

# Setup Virtual Environment
I will be using venv but use whatever virtual environment you prefer, just use one.
1. Navigate to the project directory.
